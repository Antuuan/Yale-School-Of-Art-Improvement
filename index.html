          <br><br><br><br><br><br>The Yale School of Art is a graduate school that confers MFAs in Graphic Design, Painting/Printmaking, Photography, and Sculpture; and offers undergraduate-level art courses to Yale College students. Our website exists as an ongoing collaborative experiment in digital publishing and information sharing. It functions as a wiki—all members of the School of Art community have the ability to add new, and edit most existing content.

            Developing Fall 2024 Visiting Artist lecture schedule
          </h4>

          <p2>
            Fall 2024 Visiting Artist lectures are happening primarily in person, with some guests joining us online via Zoom. Attendance for in-person lectures is limited to current members of the School of Art community, with the exception of the Paul Rand Lectures in Graphic Design which are open to the Yale community. <br><br>This page serves as an archive of those lectures, as well as the select clips and segments that may be made available on the School of Art’s YouTube channel in the coming months, in collaboration with each guest. Internal recordings of these lectures (with recording at the discretion of each guest) are made available to School of Art students, faculty, and staff via internal, non-downloadable, password-protected Dropbox folders.

            The School of Art galleries in Green Hall provide a year-round forum for the exhibition of work by students, faculty, and special guests in the four graduate departments of the School and the undergraduate program. <br><br>During exhibitions, Green Hall Gallery at 1156 Chapel Street is typically open to the public but due to COVID-19, it will remain open only to the Yale community until further notice.
